      <p>The game is initialised with a word that is hidden from the player.</p>
      <p>Guesses are made for letters that the word may contain.</p>
      <p>If the guessed letter is in the word, all instances of it are revealed.</p>
      <p>If the guessed letter is not in the word, a penalty is added.</p>
      <p>If the maximum number of penalties is met, the game is lost.</p>
      <p>If all letters in the word are revealed, the game is won.</p>
