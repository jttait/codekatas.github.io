    <h1><a href="index.html">Kata</a> > ResistorColorCode</h1>
    <p>IEC 60062:2016 defines a standard colour code for showing the rating
      of resistors.</p>
<p>The code comprises up to five coloured bands.</p>
<p>Up to three bands can be used to denote the significant figures.</p>
<p>The next band is the multiplier for these significant figures.</p>
<p>The final band is for tolerance.</p>
<p>Black denotes 0 as a significant figure or 10<sup>0</sup> as a
      multiplier.</p>
<p>Brown denotes 1 as a significant figure, 10<sup>1</sup> as a
      multiplier, or ± 1% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>Red denotes 2 as a significant figure, 10<sup>2</sup> as a 
      multiplier, or ± 2% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>Orange denotes 3 as a significant figure, 10<sup>3</sup> as a
      multiplier, or ± 0.05% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>Yellow denotes 4 as a significant figure, 10<sup>4</sup> as a
      multiplier, or ± 0.02% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>Green denotes 5 as a significant figure, 10<sup>5</sup> as a
      multiplier, or ± 0.5% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>Blue denotes 6 as a significant figure, 10<sup>6</sup> as a
      multiplier, or ± 0.25% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>Violet denotes 7 as a significant figure, 10<sup>7</sup> as a
      multiplier, or ± 0.5% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>Grey denotes 8 as a significant figure, 10<sup>8</sup> as a
      multiplier, or ± 0.1% as a tolerance.</p>
<p>White denotes 9 as a significant figure or 10<sup>9</sup> as a
      multiplier.</p>
<p>Gold denotes 10<sup>-1</sup> as a multiplier or ± 5% as a
      tolerance.</p>
<p>Silver denotes 10<sup>-2</sup> as a multiplier or ± 10% as a
      tolerance.</p>
<p>Pink denotes 10<sup>-3</sup> as a multiplier.</p>
<p>If no band is present for tolerance then it is ± 20%.</p>
<p>Express the minimum and maximum rating for a resistor based on the
      colour bands.</p>
