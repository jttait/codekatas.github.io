   <text>
      <p>A game comprises ten frames.</p>
      <p>Each frame comprises up to 2 rolls.</p>
      <p>One point is scored for each pin that is knocked down.</p>
      <p>If all 10 pins are knocked down on the first shot then the frame ends,
      you get a strike, and earn 10 points plus the sum of the next two
      shots.</p>
      <p>If all 10 pins are knocked down using both shots then you get a
      spare and earn 10 points plus the sum of the next shot.</p>
      <p>The rules are different for the 10<sup>th</sup> frame.</p>
      <p>If you roll a strike with the first shot on the first shot of the
      10<sup>th</sup> frame then you get 2 more shots.</p>
      <p>If you roll a spare with the first two shots of the 10<sup>th</sup>
      frame then you get 1 more shot.</p>
      <p>The score for the 10<sup>th</sup> frame is the total number of pins
      knocked down.</p>
