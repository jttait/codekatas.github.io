   <description>Code kata for calculating great circle distance.</description>
   <text>
      <p>A point on the Earth is defined by latitude and longitude.</p>
      <p>Latitude and longitude are defined by degrees, minutes, and seconds.</p>
      <p>There are 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a minute.</p>
      <p>Latitudes North of the Equator are positive, those South, negative.</p>
      <p>Longitudes East of the Greenwich Meridian are positive, those West, negative.</p>
      <p>The radius of the Earth is approximately 6,371 km.</p>
      <p>There are 0.017453 radians in a degree.</p>
      <p>There are 1.852 kilometres in a nautical mile.</p>
      <p>The Haversine Formula gives the great circle distance (d) between two
      points in terms of latitude in radians (&#960;) and longitude in radians
      (&#955;) where r is the radius of the Earth:</p>
      <p>\[ d = 2 \: r \: arcsin \sqrt{sin ^2 \left( \frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2} \right) + cos (\phi_1) \: cos(\phi_2) \: sin^2 \left( \frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2} \right) } \]</p>
      <p>Calculate the great circle distance between two given points in both
      nautical miles and kilometres.</p>
