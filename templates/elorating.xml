   <description>Calculate Elo ratings.</description>
   <text>
      <p>The Elo rating is used to measuring relative skill of players in
      zero-sum games like chess.</p>
      <p>The probability of player A winning against player B is given by the
      following formula where R is the rating of each player:</p>
      <p>\[E_A\ = {1 \over 1 + 10 ^ {(R_A - R_B) / 400}}\]</p>
      <p>The revised rating of player A after the game is given by:</p>
      <p>\[R'_A = R_A + K (S_A - E_A)\]</p>
      <p>S is the actual score and is 1 for win, 0.5 for draw, 0 for loss.</p>
      <p>K is a constant. FIDE uses 40 for new players, 20 for players below
      2400, and 10 for players above 2400.</p>
      <p>Update the rating of a player based on the results of a series of
      games.</p>
