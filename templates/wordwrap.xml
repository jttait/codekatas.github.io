   <description>Wrap text to maximum line length.</description>
   <text>
      <p>Given a string and a maximum line length, insert line breaks as
      required so that no line exceeds the maximum.</p>
      <p>These line breaks should replace spaces between words.</p>
      <p>However, if a single word is longer than the maximum line length then it
         should be broken and a '-' character used to indicate this.</p>
