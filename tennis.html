      <h1><a href="index.html">CodeKata</a> > Tennis</h1>
      <p>A tennis match comprises three or five sets.</p>
      <p>The first player to win a majority of the sets wins the match.</p>
      <p>Each set comprises a minimum of 6 games.</p>
      <p>A set is won by the first player to win at least six games with a
      margin of 2 above their opponent e.g. 6-3 or 7-5 although a tiebreak
      set is used when the score reaches 6-6.</p>
      <p>At Wimbeldon, this is instead done at 12-12 on the final set.</p>
      <p>A tiebreak set is is won by the first player to reach at least 7
      points and be 2 points clear of their oppponent.</p>
      <p>Tiebreak sets are scored by single points - 1, 2, 3, ...</p>
      <p>There are no games in a tiebreak set.</p>
      <p>Each games comprises several points.</p>
      <p>The points are scored as "love", "15", "30", "40", and "game".</p>
      <p>The first player to reach "game", wins the game.</p>
      <p>However, if both players have forty then it's "deuce".</p>
      <p>The next player to score in deuce gets "advantage".</p>
      <p>If the player with advantage scores the next point, they win the game.
      Otherwise, it returns to deuce.</p>
      <p>Keep track of the score during a tennis match.</p>
